This is the code to the shiny app **"Palmer Penguins body mass range data"**. You can find the the app [here](https://dezc.shinyapps.io/test/).


This app explores the dataset _Penguins_ from the R package _palmerpenguins_. These data were collected by Dr. Kristen Gorman and the Palmer Station in Antarctica (which is a member of the Long Term Ecological Research Network). They also made these data publically avalible.

Using this app, users will be able to easily visualize the range and frequencies of the recorded body masses of the different species using a interactive histogram. Users can look at any of the 3 species. They are also able to look at all 3 islands that are included in the dataset or a subset of these islands. Users are also able to control the size of bins on the histogram to more easily view borad and specific trends in body mass.
